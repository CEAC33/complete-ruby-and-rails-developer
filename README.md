### Ruby on Rails Development Environment overview

**Development Environments**
- To develop web applications you will need to create a development environment
- To develop web applications using Ruby on Rails, you will need Ruby (the language) and Ruby on Rails (the web app framework) installed

**Options**
- Cloud based IDE's, Ruby on Rails: Amazon Web Services Cloud9, Regular Cloud9 (only available through educator accounts), Codeanywhere etc., I use nitrous in a lot of the videos but nitrous isn't available anymore, but it's similar to a lot of other ones so it's very easy to follow
- Local IDE's - Rubymine by Jetbrains
- Simple local Development environment (free at best for long term): Combination of Terminal window/Command prompt, (powershell) and a code editor
